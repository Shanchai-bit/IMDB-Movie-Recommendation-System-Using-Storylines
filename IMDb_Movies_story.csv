Walk the Line,"Literally translated from Zou Xian in Mandarin, ""Walk the Line'' is a gripping phenomenon that has gone viral on Chinese social media, referring to the trek across the DariÃ©n Gap, a dangerous stretch of jungle connecting Colombia and Panama.

As a result of China's harsh Zero-COVID policies, economic downturn, and a looming threat to human rights, Chinese migrants are fleeing the world's second-largest economy, quickly becoming the fastest-growing group descending upon the US southern border. The documentary is an on-the-ground, intercontinental chronicle of this treacherous journey. Walk the Line features intimate stories of several migrants: Ivan and Lee, a same-sex couple who did not dare reveal their faces to the camera until they reached the US, hoping that their story will inspire China's oppressed LGBTQ+ community; Cindy, the only female migrant that agreed to be on-camera, who suffered extreme physical challenges in the jungle and a nine-day nightmare at the border, grappling with unemployment and loneliness, and contemplating the sacrifices made in pursuit of a better life; and Mr. Yu who, after enduring a year of van-dwelling in Beijing to evade strict lockdowns, believes this difficult journey is the best choice he has ever made. He gets baptized in a Los Angeles church, and learns English at a community college, aspiring to become a truck driver. Over the course of eight months, ""Walk the Line"" captures these migrants' extraordinary resilience and determination, and the complex journey that follows their choice. Through stunning cinematography and poignant interviews, the documentary sheds light on the profound toll of the migrant journey against the inescapable backdrop of China's tense geopolitical setting and human right crisis."

Per il mio bene,"Giovanna inherited the family business from her father, which deals with the industrial (but artisanal) processing of natural stone. The woman does not have a partner, and although she maintains a close relationship with her mother Lilia and her 15-year-old daughter Alida, it seems that she is unable to build completely sincere bonds with them or to be completely transparent. So when she gets sick, she keeps the situation hidden from the girl, and only talks to her mother because she discovers that the only cure would be an urgent liver transplant from a blood relative in adulthood. But Lilia cannot help her, because... she is not her biological mother. Giovanna discovers that she was adopted and that she has lived a life in the dark about that important information regarding her identity. And she begins a search for her biological mother, the only one who could really save her life. 'Per il mio bene' is an unusual film in the Italian panorama because, despite starting from a melodramatic premise with a high risk of television (and the first scenes struggle a bit to find the necessary tone), it unfolds cinematically in a sober and calm way, working ""in levare"" and relying on the rigor of its protagonists: Barbora Bobulova in the role of Giovanna, Marie-Christine Barrault - a very welcome return - in that of her biological mother, Sara Ciocca in the role of Alida and Stefania Sandrelli in that of Lilia. Sandrelli performs an act of great generosity in leaving the more substantial role (which she could have easily played herself) to her French colleague: but with a couple of ""piercing"" expressions she lets Lilia's living pain filter through in witnessing Giovanna's rejection (and illness), as only a great actress can do. However, it is Barrault who towers over the big screen, beautiful in her lonely and angry old age, and Bobulova holds her own, with sweetness and a sense of deep affinity. Ciocca closes this quadrilateral of painful but loving relationships, letting all the adolescent need for truth and affective presence shine through. 'Per il mio bene' is a treatise on motherhood as the ability to act ""for the good"" of one's children, without sacrificing the right to one's own identity. The excellent screenplay by Monica Zapelli, Pierpaolo De Mejo and Mimmo Verdesca, clear and never insistent, avoids underlining and spares us useless explanations on what we have already understood, also because the images and the acting of the actresses (and actors: there is a splendid cameo by Leo Gullotta, also a very welcome return) speak for themselves, and clearly. Verdesca's direction, at his debut in fictional cinema after some documentaries and supported by the essential editing of Alessio Doglione, is careful and modest, and takes all the time and calm necessary to tell an adult story in which the elderly are finally treated with respect and realism, or as the complex people they have been all their lives - and who do not deserve to be reduced to a single note, mostly ridiculous, in favor of the younger audience (or cast). In a delicate moment of her life, Giovanna needs the person who abandoned her, her biological mother. The precision of the images, the ability to narrate a story full of emotion without ever bordering on gratuitous tears, make Verdesca welcome as a director of fiction, capable of ""working the natural stone"" that is cinema with grace and competence. A curiosity: the names of two of the protagonists seem to be homages to his previous documentaries, 'Alida' (on Valli) and 'In arte Lilia Silvi' (on the diva of white telephones). 'Per il mio bene' therefore appears as a (further) gesture of gratitude from a man towards the women he observes, and wants to tell, with discretion and solicitude."

However, as often occurs in observational documentary cinema, this served merely as a starting point for the film. As filming progressed, it became apparent that the central narrative revolved around the resilience of many pensioners in the province, who survive by forming cooperative living arrangements, sharing a single household. These arrangements, born out of financial necessity, highlight the struggles of individuals whose relationships have withered over time, yet who must endure living together due to economic constraints. Pooling their pensions becomes essential for covering basic living expenses such as food, heating, and utilities. At the heart of this story is Mara, a woman who has had several husbands. One tragically deceased, the other died otherwise. Her last companion, Ivars, whom she never officially married, became her partner for 24 years. Though their relationship had long lost its spark, they remained bound together by the need to survive."

Covering over 1,000 kilometers, their expedition is not just a physical journey but a deep exploration of the land they call home. As they traverse the peninsula, they are confronted with the stunning natural beauty of Baja California-its vast deserts, rugged mountains, and pristine coastlines. However, they also witness the scars left by human activity, a reminder of the delicate balance between nature and development. From the iconic vineyards of Valle de Guadalupe to the tranquil oasis of San Ignacio, they encounter places that reveal both the power and fragility of the environment. Surgencia is more than just a road movie; it is a love letter to Baja California, penned by two men who have played pivotal roles in shaping the region's identity through wine and cuisine. D'Acosta and Molina reflect on their personal and professional journeys, sharing their thoughts on community, sustainability, and the irreversible impact of human actions on this unique landscape. Through their experiences and conversations with local people, they delve into the complexities of transformation-both of the land and themselves.

With the police raid still fresh in his mind, his experience was dominated by incomprehension. But in the years that followed, resentment took hold. Bassam was raised by his mother Fardous, a socialist activist herself. As a single parent, her life was hard, and when Mahmoud was finally released from prison he seemed like a different person.

Neshoma,"Neshoma is set in Amsterdam between World War I & II, when one out of ten of the city's residents was Jewish. Seventeen-year-old Rusha lives in the Jewish quarter with her family. Her older brother Max has emigrated to the Dutch East Indies, now Indonesia. In her letters to Max, Rusha recounts daily life in the city. This creates a vivid image of Amsterdam during the interwar period, from the perspective of the Jewish community. The film begins shortly after World War I, a period full of confidence in the future. The combination of Rusha's letters and archival footage creates a colorful portrait of proud diamond cutters; haggling traders at the flea market; cabaret artists with songs that everyone sings along to; city officials like De Miranda, who are committed to social housing; and the entrepreneurs behind warehouse De Bijenkorf, the luxurious Amstel Hotel, and cinema Tuschinski. These stories illustrate the importance of the Jewish community to the city. The initial optimism after World War I is gradually tested by a severe economic depression and the rise of fascism, leading to the occupation of The Netherlands. Humor and zest for life, the ""lechajim,"" provide comfort to the Jews in times of adversity. Against this backdrop, Rusha grows from a young girl into an independent woman, lovingly navigating between the ideas of her socialist father and the religious beliefs of her husband. The outbreak of World War II presents her with an impossible choice. Neshoma is not only about the lives of those who are no longer here, but also about what they have left behind: the Jewish soul of Amsterdam, the neshoma."

We see them talking with local people, reporting on Israeli bombardments, sleeping on just a few folded-up sheets, and struggling with a lack of phone coverage. They feel the obligation to continue their work, even though they know they are risking their lives in a conflict that spares no one. But the mission always comes first, as a seriously injured fellow journalist reports from his hospital bed.

Personale,"The washing machines are spinning, people are cleaning, folding towels, vacuuming and mopping floors. Contrary to our own experiences as guests in a hotel, we take a look behind the scenes and see what they are trying hard to hide: we observe the housekeeping team at their tiring daily work in a 4-star hotel in the Italian Dolomites. The women and few men on the staff, all with a history of migration, wear white aprons and blue gloves and ensure constant cleanliness. We follow their routine movements in the corridors, hotel rooms and the hotel laundry room. A completely new perspective opens up, determined by the cyclical repetition of the same activities: folding towels, making beds and mopping floors and bathrooms. The overriding maxim is to keep the tourist machinery running despite all internal and external resistance. There is talk of shifts that are far too long, hardly any sleep and no opportunities for vacation or sick leave. What the workers share are the brief breaks at the coffee machine or stories from their personal lives that intertwine with their daily routines. Moments of connection emerge, illuminating the hectic nature of their everyday lives. ""Personale"" radically and exclusively takes the perspective of the workers. Of the hotel guests, who usually only stay temporarily, we only discover traces, as the cleaning staff regularly finds them: dirty dishes, empty coffee cups, forgotten earrings or scraps of paper. The film takes a close look at this seemingly immaculate microcosm, tells us about the living realities of the workers, and makes visible what is meant to remain invisible."

Harder Better Faster Stronger,"The multi-trillion-dollar wellness industry has seen a strange shift over the past few years from New Age-y holistic health led by Gwyneth Paltrow to more ideology-fuelled ""manly"" optimization.

Misinformation expert and bestselling author Timothy Caulfield is no stranger to having nicknames like ""soy boy"" and ""Timmy"" thrown at him online by internet trolls attacking his masculinity anytime he speaks out against pseudo-scientific claims being legitimized by those selling health for profit. Join Timothy Caulfield on a journey inside the Manosphere to investigate the world of toxic male ""wellness"" culture and challenge its dangerous mash-up of ideology and archaic gender norms through conversations with influential figures within the movement, as well as those challenging masculine norms, including athletes, artists, men's groups, scientific experts, and more. HARDER BETTER FASTER STRONGER is a documentary that doesn't tell you the right way to be or identify as a man, but will definitely debunk the health halo part of the equation, investigating the bro-science, testosterone-obsession, raw meat diets, anti-woke ideology (and even the art of testicle tanning), in order to understand the current state of men's health as we seek to answer the question: Is manliness killing us?"

That is when Brahma educates him about the difference in the passage of time between earth and Brahmaloka, i.e., One day Brahmaloka is equivalent to the passage of all the four yugas (namely Satya Yuga, Tretha Yuga, Dvapara Yuga and Kali Yuga) on earth. Having realized this and remembering the horrendous mistake of leaving the conch shell (time turner) on earth, he rushes back with lightning speed in a quest to find it, but with no luck, returns empty handed. It is at this point that the old lady ends the tale. The main story then meanders into a village setting, highlighting a group of four young men- Ranga, Suri, Daya and Pandya, each unlike the other, yet glued together by their shared love for kabaddi and swimming. ""All that happens, happens for the good"" is one idiom that holds good for what follows next. Swimming at the dam before committing to a heavy practice session of kabaddi was something that the four lads followed ritualistically, however, this time around, their plans get tweaked, for they receive information that there happens to be a crack at the dam, making it unsafe for swimming, which thereby compels them to take a dip at the nearby well. Call it an act of deliberation or call it an act of fate because, it so happens that the conch shell (time turner) finds its way into the hands of Ranga, the grandson of the little girl who was listening that old lady's tale. No sooner does he find it, than Pandya dives from an astronomical height and drowns. Panic sets in. With a dead friend, a tournament to win and strange looking conch shell, the story revolves around the lives and deaths of these four gentlemen and the time turner. It should come as no surprise to us that as the story progresses, Ranga figures out the working of that time turner compelled by his circumstances and curiosity. However, the flip side to turning time unravels itself throughout the course of the story in interestingly morbid ways. With every usage of the time turner, the stakes of risk keep getting higher, and the death of a person becomes inevitable. After numerous trials of turning time in an attempt to keep his companions and fellow villagers alive, Ranga evokes the innate human tendencies of greed and dissatisfaction, by choosing to turn time yet again. This time around, instead of yielding the result that he had expected, it takes him to a landscape of a ginormous tree on the banks of a lake filled with lotus flowers, inhabited by a young boy with four heads holding a lotus flower in his hand. The very landscape and scenario that he had been dreaming of for all these days. If anything, it wasn't a mere act of coincidence. Afterall, as Freud would put it, dreams are pathways to our unconscious. What follows next, is up to the interpretation and amusement of the audience. Afterall, bending time comes with its repercussions, right?!"

SK13: Kubrick's Endgame,"Introducing SK13: Kubrick's Endgame, a daring documentary by director Tony Zierra (Filmworker) that delves into the enigmatic world of Stanley Kubrick, the revered maestro of cinema, and his relentless struggles to bring his visionary films to life. What if there was a hidden gem among Kubrick's filmography, a cinematic jewel yet to be discovered? The truth is, such a film does exist, and it happens to be the last creation from the ingenious mind of Stanley Kubrick: Eyes Wide Shut. When it opened in July 1999, Eyes Wide Shut faced harsh criticism from reviewers. Audiences, expecting a titillating, star-driven spectacle, were left perplexed and disappointed by this highly anticipated finale, dismissing it as the folly of a once-great director. Instead of cementing Kubrick's legacy, the film seemingly tarnished it. But can Eyes Wide Shut be so readily dismissed? After all, it is the final testament of the same visionary who gave us a slew of cinematic masterpieces: The Killing, Paths of Glory, Dr. Strangelove, Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, and Full Metal Jacket. Could Kubrick's ultimate creation truly be what many claimed-a rambling misstep from an aging recluse who had lost his touch? Director Tony Zierra refused to accept that the great Stanley Kubrick concluded his illustrious career with a tragic failure. Driven by an unwavering admiration for this cinematic giant, Zierra embarked on a two-decade-long quest to uncover the secrets behind Eyes Wide Shut and understand why Kubrick considered it his ""greatest contribution to the art of cinema."" SK13: Kubrick's Endgame is the culmination of that relentless pursuit. Through exhaustive research and exclusive interviews with key individuals, Zierra takes us on a journey through Kubrick's career and unravels the enigma surrounding Eyes Wide Shut, finally providing long-awaited answers about its inception, tumultuous production, troubled release, and enduring impact. This remarkable documentary not only presents Eyes Wide Shut in a fresh and captivating light, but also deepens our understanding of Kubrick's boundlessly creative mind. It's a look behind the mask of contemporary society that sheds light on Kubrick's vulnerability as an artist and the immense obstacles he conquered in shaping his timeless body of work. Get ready to experience Kubrick's last film for the first time. You'll never see Eyes Wide Shut or Stanley Kubrick the same way again."

The Life of Sean DeLear,"A blazingly colorful and exuberantly transgressive personality who dazzled Los Angeles' underground musical and artistic scenes in the late-1990s and 2000s, Sean DeLear (1964-2017) suddenly emerged as a genuinely seminal cultural figure via the posthumous 2022 publication of their intimate and explicit teenage diaries from 1979. I Could Not Believe It joyously chronicles the experiences of a young Black, queer creative finding their identity, voice and style decades before Barry Jenkins' (rather more downbeat) Moonlight. The Life of Sean DeLear is a vibrantly multi-faceted, buoyantly propulsive documentary portrait of this irresistibly charismatic one-off - sketched in celebratory but commendably clear-eyed style by writer-director Markus Zizenbacher. There can be very few people better qualified to do justice to this particular tale. Zizenbacher befriended DeLear - born Anthony Robertson in Simi Valley, an obscure California backwater - after the latter relocated to Vienna in the early 2010s. There the former front-person of Silver Lake post-punk-combo Glue reinvented themselves as a cabaret performer and collaborated with famed art-collective Gelitin before passing away aged just 52. ""SeanDe"" entrusted their treasure-trove audiovisual archive to Zizenbacher, who with co-editor Sebastian Schreiner has crafted an eclectic collage generously spiced with effervescent extracts from DeLear's own extensive video-diaries. These jagged hand-held snapshots bring back to often-hilarious life the electric days (and especially nights) from a quarter of a century ago, placed in retrospective context by present-day testimony from the survivors who knew SeanDe best and loved them the most. Sean DeLear - as in ""chandelier"" - lit up their world; Markus Zizenbacher now illuminates Sean DeLear for ours."

Gabriel is a brilliant strategist, known for his analytical mind and his ability to foresee every move on the board. He is the brains of the group, always one step ahead, but with a dark past that haunts him. Oscar, a persuasive and skilled negotiator, has a gift for manipulating people and making everyone believe that he is on their side, even if their loyalty is always at stake. And finally, Sergio, an unscrupulous visionary, willing to destroy everything and everyone to get what he wants, regardless of the consequences. In this world where alliances are fleeting and betrayals are commonplace, appearances can be deceiving and no one is who they seem to be. Each of the four has their own game, their own hidden motivations, and their own vision of power. As they move closer to total control of the corporation, tensions rise and the lines between morality and ambition blur. What begins as an intricate dance of strategy and manipulation quickly turns into a bloody battle for survival. When each player's darkest secrets come to light, loyalties fracture and chaos threatens to consume them all. All four players will be forced to make extreme decisions that could destroy not only their careers, but their lives. As the finale approaches, Sonia must face the most devastating betrayal of all: that which comes from those she once considered allies. In a world where power is everything and loyalty is a luxury, The Power Game takes us on a dizzying journey of intrigue, ambition and revenge, where the riskiest plays don't always have a winner, and where losing is easier than it seems."

What started as innocent curiosity turned into a life-altering nightmare. A classmate had vanished without a trace, and determined to solve the mystery, the group ventured deep into the town's forbidden woods. There, they discovered something far worse than they could have imagined: Romanova, a witch of unspeakable evil, centuries old and fueled by dark rituals that involved sacrificing children to expand her immense powers. That night, the friends narrowly escaped, but they lost one of their own-a friend who would never come home. The trauma of what they saw and experienced haunted them, even as they grew older and went their separate ways. Now adults, LuÃ­s remains tormented by memories of Romanova and what happened that night. While the others have tried to bury the past and move on, LuÃ­s has spent years obsessively researching the witch's origins, her power, and the lore that surrounds her. Convinced that Romanova was never truly defeated, LuÃ­s believes she is preparing to rise again. His obsession turns into grim validation when strange events begin to occur in their hometown. Children are disappearing once more, and eerie signs-symbols carved into trees, whispers in the dark, and shadowy figures-indicate that Romanova's power is returning. Desperate to stop the witch before she fully regains her strength, LuÃ­s reconnects with Sabrina, RogÃ©rio, and Vasco. Reluctant at first, the group's fears are reignited as LuÃ­s reveals unsettling evidence. Together, they return to the place that has haunted them for years: the woods where it all began. But the Romanova they face now is stronger, more vengeful, and far more dangerous. As their bonds are tested and long-buried secrets resurface, LuÃ­s and his friends realize they are not just fighting to stop Romanova-they're fighting to survive. The line between past and present blurs as the friends confront their childhood trauma, uncover dark truths about Romanova's origins, and come face to face with their deepest fears. LuÃ­s, driven by guilt and revenge, must make an ultimate sacrifice to destroy the witch before she consumes more innocent lives. But Romanova is cunning, and her power has grown beyond anything they expected. As the final confrontation looms, the group discovers that defeating her may require more than they're willing to give. Will LuÃ­s and his friends succeed in breaking Romanova's curse, or will they become part of her dark legacy, doomed to be forgotten like so many before them?"

After being liberated from Buchenwald, Adolf, penniless, traveled to Prague to redeem his father's life insurance. Rather than being consoled as a survivor of unspeakable horrors, he was thrown out of the insurance company office. He was told: ""No death certificate, no insurance claim."" Not until 1996 did the matter arise again. Adolf's niece, attorney Lisa Stern, heard the story through family members. Lisa teamed up with the pioneer of bad faith insurance law, William Shernoff, and set off on an incomparable legal odyssey. Against all odds, the two lawyers were determined to right the wrong perpetrated on Adolf and other survivors by insurance companies, which were supposed to take care of their policyholders in times of need. This David and Goliath account explores how persistence and powerful advocacy can achieve justice for wrongs committed half a century ago in a foreign land."

After a near-fatal accident, he decides to climb the hardest route of his life - on the Mediterranean island of Kalymnos, Greece. It's a story of passion, dedication, crisis and a second chance at life. The main character is Maciej ""Pastor"" Kubera, 52, who suffers a tragic fall while climbing, breaking dozens of bones. From his hospital bed, he vows to come back stronger than ever to climb a super-steep route called Andromeda on Kalymnos. The film paints an intense portrait of a man who imposes a draconian training regime on himself, with his life governed by the schedule in his training logbook. To his own surprise, he finds that his needs go far beyond physical strength - he is now limited by his psyche. Fear has taken over his climbing and he doesn't know how to tame this previously unknown beast. For this he needs his wife as a partner, and he needs a help from friends. We embark on an adventurous journey with our man - from psychotherapy rooms to climbing coaching sessions to friends and family reunions in the mountains of Greece, Spain, England and Poland. And even to the music studio, where he is working on the performance of his own rap lyrics (about climbing of course) at a very noisy concert. Will all this be enough to overcome this enormous challenge and fulfill his lifelong climbing dream? Will he emerge victorious from his vertical duel with the limestone and with himself? And what will he learn about crisis and second chances? The movie is about crisis and second chances in life. How we deal with life when it takes a sharp turn."

The Trash Goes Out on Tuesday,"""The Trash Goes Out On Tuesday"" chronicles the extraordinary life of actress and comedian Tuesday Thomas: coming to grips with being Trans in the early 70s when there were no words, internet, books or television to show her what she was. She embarked on an arduous journey to find her own tribe and live her truth. With a biological father that tries to kidnap her, a predatory priest, and a mother who doesn't understand what is wrong with her son, Tuesday had to leave home to become the person she knew she was inside. She finds friends and foes in the LGBTQ+ community, the one place she should be safe but wasn't always. Doing shows to make money, she was getting hormones wherever she could: including black markets and shady doctors. All this at a time when trans health-care was 'unofficial' and deadly, if it existed at all. After all, the median age for trans women at the time was said to be only 35. After surviving sexual assaults, outing, drug addiction and more she thought she'd found happiness and got married in Vegas. However, her husband soon reveals himself to be a drug-addicted lunatic who leaves her sick and alone. Tuesday goes home to recover, where she reconnects with the family she once felt so alienated from. While trying to divorce her husband, he begins to stalk and harass her, chasing her across the country for almost a decade, including orchestrating a conspiracy to have her killed for the insurance money. Finally, after he gets deported back to Canada, Tuesday faces her final battle. The breast implants Tuesday had gotten over 20 years ago break and start poisoning her with silicone. Ultimately, due to inadequate health care, death-for-profit insurance companies, and Transphobia running rampant in health care, Tuesday is forced to flee the country to get the medical care she needs to survive. Following the COVID-19 lock-down, Tuesday triumphantly returns to the stage. She knows the only reason she has survived while so many of her kind have perished, is to make people happy and heal them through laughter. As Tuesday says, ""There aren't many trans women who are left at this age."" Tuesday shares her story so that future generations can learn from her rare wisdom, and to honor all her friends who have been lost along the way who are unable to share their own."

Im Haus der alten Augustin,"Ãsterreich, 1986. Es ist das Jahr der Waldheim-Wahl, doch KÃ¼nstler Albin (Gerald Pribek) hat andere Sorgen. Erst offenbart ihm sein Kollege Sir Tralala (David Hebenstreit himself), dass der von Albin praktizierte Naturalismus seit 100 Jahren tot ist und die Moderne Ã¼bernommen hat, dann macht auch noch seine Freundin Ida (Lisa-Carolin Nemec) mit ihm Schluss. Beim Versuch, Ida zurÃ¼ckzuerobern, steht Albin deren jagdbegeisterter Vater Dr. Hampapa (Clemens Aap Lindenberg) im Weg, der ihn nicht ausstehen kann und nicht nur gerne Hasen schieÃt. Bis sich zum toten Naturalismus ein toter Naturalist gesellt, der sich dann doch als jemand anderer herausstellt - und die Dinge immer gruseliger werden. Wie es eben geht, wenn man etwas zu tief hinter gutbÃ¼rgerliche Fassaden blickt. Im Haus der alten Augustin beginnt lustig und endet ernsthaft. Oder eher: beginnt mit Kunst und endet im Blut. Doch waren SpaÃ und Ernst, Kunst und Blut je wirklich getrennt? Ist, in einem Land wie Ãsterreich, das VerrÃ¼ckte nicht immer schon das Authentische und umgekehrt? Man nehme das Hermann-Nitsch-Bild, das sich Dr. Hampapa ins Esszimmer gehÃ¤ngt hat, weil er, wie er sagt, es sich leisten kann. Albin, der als ""Naturalist"" Nitsch verachtet, empÃ¶rt sich: ""Einen KÃ¼bel Blut Ã¼ber die Leinwand schÃ¼tten und fÃ¼r eine Million Schilling an irgendwelche Kunstbanausen verkaufen? Da scheiÃ ich drauf, Oida."" Die Blutorgie der modernen Kunst wird zum Vorboten eines Schreckens, der im Patriarchen Dr. Hampapa seine perfekte VerkÃ¶rperung findet. Und ist der gespenstisch-strenge Herr mit dem komischen Namen nicht auch ein WiedergÃ¤nger des Ex-Nazis Kurt Waldheim, der es gerade darauf anlegt, sich zum PrÃ¤sidenten der Republik wÃ¤hlen zu lassen? WÃ¤hrenddessen strebt die Generation von Albin und Ida in die Zukunft: Der lÃ¤ssige, improvisiert wirkende Wiener KÃ¼nstler:innenslang klingt ganz nach unserem Hier und Jetzt. Ein Horrorthriller mit massivem SchmÃ¤heinschlag, in dem zwischen 1986 und heute nur ein Wimpernschlag liegt - das gibt es in dieser Form auch nur ""made in Austria""."

Seul Godard,"How do you craft the portrait of Jean-Luc Godard, or better yet a portrait of his methodology, his universe, his way of constructing or deconstructing cinema, that is equal to his own cinematic audacity and genius? How could it be anything other than by taking risks, and trying out equally radical methods, never straying from to his example. The two filmmakers immerse us into the storage warehouse where, in 2010, all the archives kept by Godard in Switzerland were transferred, and they create a doppelganger (or a duplicate) of the director, who takes up the role of our guide into his world. Excerpts from his writings, his images, his perspective in cinema give us a glimpse into his mythology, his techniques, his singular gaze, and therefore also in his worldview. His questions, his relentless experimentation in cinema, and the nature of creation are showcased here as being both truly prolific, as well as still relevant, while they are intricately intertwined into a film essay that we are certain even Godard himself would have enjoyed."

Except from imminent adulthood, the girls from Tell Them About Us also have to deal with another complicated condition; despite their Arab, Kurdish and Roma origins, they are growing up in a provincial town in Germany.

In 2013, the young journalist Eric Lembembe was murdered in Cameroon. He was tortured and beaten to death because he was gay and had fought for gay rights. Shocked by this gruesome murder in his home country, filmmaker Appolain Siewe sets off for Cameroon to find out more about the situation of LGBTQI+ people there. He soon realizes that Lembembe's murder is no isolated case. Same-gender sexual orientation is still a criminal offense in Cameroon, as it is in almost all African countries. Being gay is completely taboo and is considered an embarrassment for families. While making the film, Siewe examines his own homophobic upbringing and seeks contact with members of his family. Since living in Europe, his outlook has changed. For his father, on the other hand, making a film on the subject is enough for him to break off all contact. Why is homophobia so firmly anchored in Cameroon's society? What role does colonization have to play in this?

Our characters communicate with us intimately as they talk about their lives and bring us closely into their personal journey. They speak about freedom and oppression, about the promise of sacrificing their lives for the sake of their families' survival. But also about the breaking of gender barriers and the power of the human mind to decide who we want to be. The film turns stereotypes and projections of gender discussions upside down. The Burneshas expand our awareness of human life and its universal conditions but in the end their story shows that the essences of life, which are identified as female, are held as less valuable, even less worth living. And that this remains so, worldwide."

By mixing micro-stories of brave teachers, and an in-depth analysis of the education system by authorities, academics, and NGOs, ""War on Education"" investigates the current situation of the school system and the historical reform happening in a time of war. The misuse of history by Putin, including the introduction of a single history schoolbook and the systematic attacks on education, is the result of an ancient strategy that finds its origins in the times of the Tsars. The Russian army is systematically targeting Ukrainian educational institutions and state actors deny Ukrainian identity and right to exist as a Nation. This is happening because they know that education is a weapon they have been using to impose their views on past, present and future generations... Ukrainians' resilience shows what a people can do if they are united to change things. The film tells a story that, while only touched on the surface by major international newspapers, urges mainstream attention."

Through early documentaries from the period, ethnographic objects and importantly, through her own imagination, Alexandra begins her journey back into her grandmother's world.

Located at the Milan Bollate Prison, In Galera restaurant is a concrete example of social reintegration of inmates. What makes it unique is not only the high-quality dining experience it offers, but above all the stories of those who work there. Indeed, In Galera is a place where the stories of different people in prison intersect, each with their own experience and perspective. For some inmates, working in the kitchen or hall means more than just having a temporary occupation. It is a chance to prove their ability to keep up with professional standards in the industry, acquire new skills and demonstrate their ability to work as part of a team. In this sense, In Galera also represents an opportunity for redemption for those who have made mistakes in the past. But the restaurant is not only a place of work for inmates, it is also a way for the outside community to get in touch with prison reality in a new and different way. It thus becomes a bridge between the prison and the outside world, a place where social and cultural differences can be overcome through the sharing of a common passion: quality food. In summary, In Galera represents a project of great social value, able to offer an opportunity of redemption to inmates and to bring the outside community closer to the prison reality."
